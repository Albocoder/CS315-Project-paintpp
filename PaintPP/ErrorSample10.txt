//this program decides if the shape is a rectangle, a line or a circle and draws it. If the boolean variable isRect is true and and isLine is false, then the shape becomes a Rectangle if the isLine is true and isRect is false then the shape becomes a Line and if bot of them are true or false the shape becomes a circle.
